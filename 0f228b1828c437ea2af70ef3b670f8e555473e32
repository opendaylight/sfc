      "message": "Brady sorry, I didn\u0027t fix this yet (using of Mockito \u0026 Powermock at once). There is no way how to mock static method with Mockito so I had to do it with Powermock. But remove mockito, it means rewrite whole test class. If it\u0027s so important, mark this -1 and i will fix it asap\n\nand please review rest of this ps",
