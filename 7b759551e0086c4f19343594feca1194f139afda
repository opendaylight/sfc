Besides several RSPs can be spawned from the same SFP, so you can not nail the locators here.\n\nWhen you build a OVS VXLAN overlay you need to construct the tunnels and therefore there is way to find out next-hop locators, it comes from the configuration. Something equivalent needs to be done for other encaps. \n\nYou need a function f(current SFF, next SFF), tell me the data plane locators. If that is available teh solution to this problem is straightforward.\n\nWe probably need to discuss on the next meeting.",
