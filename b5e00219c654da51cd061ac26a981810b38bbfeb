      "message": "The two actions below run in different executors. This means that it is not guaranteed that you will first delete the old ACL action and then insert the new one. It might happens that you insert the new one and then it is deleted right after.\n\nIs there any reason you need to delete the old action first? It seems in setAclEntriesSfcAction you are building a new aceArrayList so why not use the new values directly.",

      "message": "The reason for deleting old ACL Action is in case when different (new) ACL is used. Then, old ACL is unset to be available for further use. This is keeping only ONE ACL per Classifier.\n\nWhat you proposed (direct use of new values) is happening in case when the ACL is the same (see if condition comparing ACL names) and just its Action was changed. Then it\u0027s directly set to new Action.",
