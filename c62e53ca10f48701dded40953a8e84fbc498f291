      "message": "Correct two typos: \"fatures\" to \"features\", \"appraoch\" to \"approach\".\n\nI think this new allocation type is not necessary, it is just a temporary solution, the root cause of this issue is GBP classifier has no capability to route a VxLAN-gpe+NSH packet to next hop without changing its destination IP. Actually, an well-encapsulated packet has included VNID and destination IP, why do we need to put them into NSH context header? I think our current issue is we have not an efficient way to route this VxLAN-gpe+NSH to every SFF and keep its outer IP header intact, this is ovs\u0027s bug, every hop shouldn\u0027t de-capsulate to get all vxlan header + nsh header info.",
