On last hop, for nsh, this could come from nshc1.\n- Let\u0027s say that we store on another register a code for the transport type plus associated data (example, vxlan + tun id). On last hop, for nsh, this could come from nshc2.\n\nThen we probably could have a transport egress table that is just based on transport and not on path+index.",
