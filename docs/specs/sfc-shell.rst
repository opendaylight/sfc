==========================================
Karaf Command Line Interface (CLI) for SFC
==========================================

[S: https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/#/q/topic:sfc-shell]

The Karaf Container offers a very complete Unix-like console that allows managing
the container. This console can be extended with custom commands to manage the
features deployed on it. This feature will add some basic commands to show the
provisioned SFC's entities.

Problem description
===================
This feature will implement commands to show some of the provisioned SFC's
entities:

-  Service Functions

-  Service Function Forwarders

-  Service Function Chains

-  Service Function Paths

-  Service Function Classifiers

Use Cases
---------
* Use Case 1: list one/all provisioned Service Functions.
* Use Case 2: list one/all provisioned Service Function Forwarders.
* Use Case 3: list one/all provisioned Service Function Chains.
* Use Case 4: list one/all provisioned Service Function Paths.
* Use Case 5: list one/all provisioned Service Function Classifiers.
