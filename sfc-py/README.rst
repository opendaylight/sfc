Service Function Chaining
=========================

Service Function Chaining provides the ability to define an ordered list of a
network services (e.g. firewalls, load balancers). These service are then
"stitched" together in the network to create a service chain. This project
provides the infrastructure (chaining logic, APIs) needed for ODL to provision
a service chain in the network and an end-user application for defining such
chains.
