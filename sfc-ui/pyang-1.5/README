Install
-------
In this directory run:

  python setup.py install

(this might require root access)


To install in a different location, run:

  python setup.py install --prefix=/usr/local

If you do this, it is recommended to set the environment variable
YANG_INSTALL to the prefix directory.  This ensures that pyang will
find standard YANG modules.


Run locally without installing
